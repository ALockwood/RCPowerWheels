# RCPowerWheels
Arduino (Uno) code for my Xbox 360 remote controlled Power Wheels Jeep.

## Why
I went to buy my son a Power Wheels Jeep on Kijiji a long time ago and ended up getting two Jeeps and spare parts for $50. My son loves driving his Jeep around and I thought it would be fun to build an RC jeep that could race him... So I did.

## What
It's an older PW Jeep with a metal frame. I replaced the tires with rubber tires as a PoC for doing it on the Jeep my son drives. I used a (slow) 4" stroke linear actuator for steering control which is controlled by a Pololu Jrk controller. Forward/reverse brushed motor control is handled with a Cytron MD30C brushed motor controller. An Arduino Uno handles RC input from am Xbox 360 remote and communicates with both motor controllers.

## Notes
My last edit to the Arduino sketch was done via notepad++ and I haven't actually compiled it or uploaded it to test (yes, I'm a terrible person). If you want something that for sure works, look at the initial commit.
I'll be back to complete this github repo when I finish my basement reno :\
