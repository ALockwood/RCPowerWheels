Arduino (Uno) code for my Xbox 360 remote controlled Power Wheels Jeep.

## Project Page
I'm working on it. It's here: http://alockwood.github.io/RCPowerWheels/

## What
It's an older PW Jeep with a metal frame. I replaced the tires with rubber tires as a PoC for doing it on the Jeep my son drives. I used a (slow) 4" stroke linear actuator for steering control which is controlled by a Pololu Jrk controller. Forward/reverse brushed motor control is handled with a Cytron MD30C brushed motor controller. An Arduino Uno handles RC input from am Xbox 360 remote and communicates with both motor controllers.
