        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            A few years ago I thought it would be fun to get my son a motorized riding toy to drive around in so my wife and I could extend our walks. I went to Kijiji and found someone selling two full jeeps, 2 additional spare gear boxes with motors, and about a dozen wheels for $50. I was at their house within the hour! <br/>
            To my surprise both Jeeps worked perfectly but there were only enough batteries for one so I stored the other Jeep away with plans to use it for parts when things broke.
        </p>
        <p>
            My son turned out to be a natural at driving and even after upgrading his Jeep to 18V he was looking for a challenge. The parts Jeep became known as "Daddy's Jeep" and he wanted to know when we could race. I explained I was a little too big to ride it and suggested maybe we could make it remote controlled. He loved the idea and the project was started.

        <h2>What is it Made Of?</h2>
        The jeep is made of parts I mainly already owned. An Xbox 360 remote and USB receiver? Check! An Arduino Uno? Check! Everything else came from Princess Auto, RobotShop.ca, or DX.com.

        <dl>
            <dt>Aruino Uno</dt>
            <dd>
                The "brains" of the operation. Responsible for RX/TX from Xbox 360 Remote via USB shield and communication with liner actuator and brushed motor controllers.<br/>
                Source: On-hand, but originally purchased from one of my many trips to Sayal Electronics.
            </dd>
            <dt>Arduino USB Shield</dt>
            <dd>
                Plugs into the Uno and provides USB host capabilities. Required for use with the Xbox 360 USB receiver which was sold for PC connectivity.<br/>

            </dd>
            <dt>Pololu Jrk Linear Actuator Controller</dt>
            <dd>An easy to use, and extremely compact controller for a linear actuator.<br/>
                Source: RobotShop.ca
            </dd>
            <dt>Cytron MD30C Brushed Motor Controller</dt>
            <dd>Motor controller for stock brushed motors. The controller was cheap, had multiple interfaces for control, and was 100% solid state. It's been working very well.<br/>
