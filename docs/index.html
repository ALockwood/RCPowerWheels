        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            A few years ago I thought it would be fun to get my son a motorized riding toy to drive around in so my wife and I could extend our walks. I went to Kijiji and found someone selling two full jeeps, 2 additional spare gear boxes with motors, and about a dozen wheels for $50. I was at their house within the hour! <br/>
            To my surprise both Jeeps worked perfectly but there were only enough batteries for one so I stored the other Jeep away with plans to use it for parts when things broke.
        </p>
        <p>
            My son turned out to be a natural at driving and even after upgrading his Jeep to 18V he was looking for a challenge. The parts Jeep became known as "Daddy's Jeep" and he wanted to know when we could race. I explained I was a little too big to ride it and suggested maybe we could make it remote controlled. He loved the idea and the project was started.
        </p>

        <h2>What is it Made Of?</h2>
        The jeep is made of parts I mainly already owned. An Xbox 360 remote and USB receiver? Check! An Arduino Uno? Check! Everything else came from Princess Auto, RobotShop.ca, or DX.com.<br/>
        I also threaded the ends of the axles so that I could put on some proper nylock nuts.

        <h2>How Do the Controls Work?</h2>
        The controls are pretty simple. Early on I identified two main goals:
        <ol>
            <li>I wanted to ensure it would be hard to quickly switch between forward and reverse to prevent wear on the plastic gearboxes.</li>
            <li>I wanted to have a 'deadman' switch on it. Meaning that if the remote disconnected for any reason all power to the motors would be cut.</li>
        </ol>
        So, with those goals in mind I configured the 360 controller to work like this:
        <ul>
            <li>The system starts in 'search' mode and the Xbox button must be pressed to pair contoller and receiver.</li>
            <li>Once paired, the player 1 light is lit indicating a pairing and forward is selected as the drive direction.</li>
            <li>If the d-pad is pressed up or down the player 1 and player 3 lights will toggle to indicate forward or reverse drive direction. The vechicle must not be receiving a drive speed command to toggle drive direction.</li>
            <li>Pulling the right trigger will enable movement in the direction set. Movement is scaled to the analog input (light pull - slow, full pull - max speed)</li>
            <li>Moving the left analog stick along the x-y axis values to steer the jeep.</li> 
            <li>Pressing the Xbox button, removing the batteries, or going out of range will trigger the deadman switch (code) and put the receiver back into search mode.</li>
        </ul>
